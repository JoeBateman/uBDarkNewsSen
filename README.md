# MicroBooNE Sensitivity to Dark Neutrino Upscattering

This notebook aims to investigate the sensitivity of MicroBooNE to upscattering to neutrinos to dark neutrinos, subsequently decaying to $e^+e^-$ pairs.

The first objective is to perform a sensitivity test using the BNB, the approximate limits of which can be compared to the limits set from a full analysis.
Once the sensitivity test method has been validated using the BNB, sensitivity using the NuMI beam will be calculated to evaluate the viability of using NuMI in such a search.
